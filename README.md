Iâ€™m a dedicated Computer Engineer currently undergoing my graduate studies with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). With a strong foundation in Cloud Computing, AI/ML, Programming, and Deep Learning concepts. Coupled with hands-on experience in application development and project management experience, I bring a dynamic skill set to the table.
