### Welcome, I'm JadeAnt! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a dedicated Computer Engineer with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). With a strong foundation in Cloud Computing, AI/ML, Programming, and Deep Learning concepts. Coupled with hands-on experience in application development and project management experience, I bring a dynamic skill set to the table.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own indie game for fun with C# and Unity!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI/ML concepts @NYU
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've traveled to 10 different countries!
